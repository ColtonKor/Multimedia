 How to Run: Traverse to the Folder containing the Python environment. Then, run this command, .\cst205env\Scripts\Activate.ps1, or something similar.
 After it is activated, you then traverse to the folder of the project. Then run this command, flask y--app Final --debug run.
 Once that is done, you go to your browser and type in http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and the website is up on your computer.

Future Work: If we were to continue this project, we would make it so that every time the Fortnite shop refreshes, it would send an email to the user if their favorited skins were in the shop.
We would also add another API that checks Steam. So it would send an email if their favorited games were currently on sale.
